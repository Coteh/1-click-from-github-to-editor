## Installation

To install the chrome extension:

1. [Download the extension](`./git-peek-chrome-extension.zip`)
2. Drag and drop the `.zip` file into `chrome://extensions`

It'll be in the Chrome Store eventually, they're just taking a little while to review it. The source for the extension is in this repo if you want to look at the code yourself.
